## Description
This project uses Express.js to save and retireve notes from a JSON file. I built this project to practice back end development. This project was already created on the front end and it was my job to create the back end server and connect them together. I learned GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods and got very comfortable with them. My project stands out because I completed the bonus part of the project which was to utilize the DELETE method.

## Usage

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.

## Tests
Try my application for yourself and add, delete, and view notes.
